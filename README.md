# Domain Driven Design ASP.NET-Microservices-App - Seller
#### ASP.NET Core Server + Angular Client

### Seller APP Idea
This is **extreamly** simple app for Listing Properties on the market, make offfers and make deal for them.

## Domain Driven Design part
**Seller.Listings** Microservice is **reworked with DDD**
**Seller.Offers** Microservice is **reworked with DDD**
**Seller.Shared.DDD**  for containing All **Domain Driven Design Common Code**

### Domain Driven Design idea in this app
#### Here My goal is simple **Clean Architecture** as it could be that easy ... so we have to Split the app on Layers 
1. Domain Layer - Entities - no data anotations, validations, custom domain exceptions, private setters, internal constuctors, public factories only for the aggregate roots
2. Application Layer - using Intefaces and Commands (All but GET) & Queries (GET) for every call from the controllers, using MediatoR, using Input and Output Models
3. Infrastructure Layer - Using Repository patern
4. Presentation Layer - using Controllers with No application logic
5. Test - App is generaly Tested with the Client, but there are some thest on Listings MS Domain Layer, Infrastructure Layer and Start Project

##### In a few words on my FIRST DDD app I just tryed to split the app and integrate as much DDD concepts as I can and have the client app to asure myself if wroks as intended so these are the flows in the app that I can see:

### What is Missing from Domain Driven Design Consepts or simply can be done better:
1. Domain - Value Objects Not used, Enumerations Not used, Events Not used, Validations only in domain layer
2. Application - Automapper is Not used 
3. Infrastructure - No DB objects
4. Test - The app is Not truly tested only few test are made
5. Offers MS Repository is too messy with a lot of logic. On Listing MS the tree repositories there are a lot cleaner.
